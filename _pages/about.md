I'm Yifan Wu, a second-year graduate student from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/).

My research is broadly focused on AI for **Healthcare** and **Large Language Models** (LLMs). 
Below are some topics I have been working on or exploring:

+ AI for Healthcare: utilizing GraphML and Transformers to study the associations among genes, proteins, and diseases. 

Feel free to reach out if you would like to collaborate on AI for Healthcare, and LLM.
